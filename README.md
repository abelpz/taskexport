# tasksExport PoC

Create tasks for translating and checking unfoldingWord resources and export them to clickUp.

To test this script run node index.js in your terminal.
You wil need the id from the clickUp list where you want the tasks to be added, and the token from your clickup app. See: <https://clickup20.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/authentication>

Add both params to the token and listId constants in [checking.sendTW.js](./res/checking.sendTW.js)
